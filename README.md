# Morphometric-Analysis
Morphometry is the study of the size and shape of the brain and its structures. 
The brain changes as it grows into adulthood, decays with age, and undergoes disease processes. 
The shape of the brain is highly dependent on genetic factors as well.
All these properties have made brain morphometry one of the most studied modalities in brain imaging. 
There are several metrics that one can use to test a morphometry-related hypothesis such as gray matter volume, 
white matter volume, cortical thickness, or cortical curvature. 
This talk will describe two techniques for analyzing brain morphometry: voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based analysis (SBA).
